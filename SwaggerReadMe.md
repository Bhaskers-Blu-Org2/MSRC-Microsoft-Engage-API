The documentation (in the form of swagger documentation) can be used to help developers who wish to implement their own API requests / response handling to get the correct responses and fields. For more information check out http://swagger.io It is a great project and has great staff working on it. To view the API, you can open the swagger-ui demo and put the link to the raw swagger.json in the top bar then click explore. swagger-ui can be downloaded locally and ran if you need to integrate this into how you interact with the api.
